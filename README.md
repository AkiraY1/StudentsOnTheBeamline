# Students on the Beamlines (SotB)

## What is SotB?

Students on the Beamline is an annual competition for Canadian high school students. Students submit a project proposal to the Canadian Light Source (CLS) (one of Canada's two particle accelerator facilities) and the winning team conducts their experiment at the CLS. For our team, the whole process took two years, from beginning ideation to finally presenting our results to researchers in Saskatchewan.

## The Code

This repostory has the code (xy2tab_mod.py) that I used to analyze the raw bond length and angle data we recorded at the CLS. The instructions to use the code are in Bonds_Instructions.pdf. Example pdb and xyz files are given as well.

The code is modified from Sebastian Dechert's (radi0sus) xyz2tab project.

The final slideshow we created for the presentation is [SotB_Presentation.pdf](https://github.com/AkiraY1/StudentsOnTheBeamline/blob/main/SotB_Presentation.pdf).
